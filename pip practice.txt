1. (pip install Django) this returned a series of progress bars as it installed the requested service, explaining what is was installing, followed by a success message.
2. (pip list) this returned the installed packages and their version.
3. (pip install Django) returned "Requirement already satisfied", meaning it knows the package is already installed.
4. (pip freeze) this returns a similar list to (pip list), however the versions are shown as evaluated to be equal to  the packages, "=="
5. (pip freeze > requirements.txt, dir requirements.txt) The file is shown to be 127 bytes. The file contains the output of (pip freeze), much as would be expected.
6. (pip uninstall Django) This uninstalled Django after a prompt.
7. (pip show Django) this returned nothing, likely because Django is no longer installed.
8. (pip search Flask) this returned a massive list in two columns, which appear to be plug-ins and descriptions. Given the descriptions and the beta/alpha versions tags, these are likely 3rd party plug-ins.
